# Intro
This is my take on the Frank Lloyd Wright table lamp he designed for his house Taliesin in Wisconsin. I was inspired by seeing a wooden one in an art museum's gift shop. It was pretty but I didn't want to spend the $ to buy it, so my dad said, "Why don't you just make one?"--so I did!

# Print Orientation
Here are the various parts you'll need to print, facing the orientation best suited for printing.

# Infill Suggestions
Feel free to deviate from these suggestions, but I tried to strike a balance between print speed, material usage, and strength.
<table>
    <tr><td><b>Part</b></td><td><b>Infill Percentage</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Sconce</td><td>5%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Slat</td><td>5%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tower Section</td><td>15%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tower Section Spacer</td><td>15%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lamp Holder</td><td>15%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Base</td><td>20%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Side Brace</td><td>5-15%*</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Top Cap</td><td>15%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Top Cap Spacer</td><td>15%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Top Cap Connector</td><td>15%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Raceway Cap</td><td>15%</td></tr>
</table>
*The majority was printed using 5%, except the area around the screw holes, which was printed with 15% for additional strength.
